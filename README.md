# Vectors
This is a test project that allows you to display a graph of an eigenvector on the screen in two lines

# How to use
The initial template with instructions is presented below:

**Please note to take the code from the files render.py and vector.py , they should be located in the same folder as your python executable**
```
# importing the vector2 module
import vector

# importing the render module
import render



# creating a new vector
v = vector.Vector2(x = 1, y = 2)

# creating a new graph
r = render.Graph()

# adding a vector to a graph
r.addVector(v)

# launching the graph
r.run()
```
