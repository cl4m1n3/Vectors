```Python
# importing the vector module
from vector import *

# importing the render module
from render import *


# creating a new vector
vector = Vector2(x = 1, y = 2)

# creating a new graph
graph = Graph()

# adding a vector to a graph
graph.addVector(vector)

# launching the graph
graph.run()
```
